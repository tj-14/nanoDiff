# nanoDiff

This project aims to implement diffusion models with pytorch in order to
understand how the model works.

## Plan

1. Take high-level structure from Diffusers
   (https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.20.0/quicktour)
2. Focus on diffusion method without latent space first
3. Re-implement inference part by part
4. Re-implement training part by part with small datasets (16x16 pixels)
